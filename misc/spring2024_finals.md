# spring2024 finals.

## stat400: may13, 8:00am @ arm0126.

**Minimum Score (to keep an A+):** $89\%$, but if I just care about getting an A, I can get by with a $69\%$. I will be a bit sad if I can't get an $89$ though.

## math401: may13, 1:30pm @ hbk0109.

**Minimum Score (???):** genuinely no idea, so I unironically need a $100\%$. We get a formula sheet and stuff anyways.

## cmsc330: may13, 4:00pm @ esj1224.

**Minimum Score (to keep an A):** $83\%$, which is probably pretty easy. Can't get an A+ in this class so no point caring about an insanely high score.

## math475: may14, 8:00am @ phy2124.

**Minimum Score (to keep a B):** $79\%$, but this is a bit embarassing. I would like at least an $80\%$. A $99\%$ gets me a B+, but that isn't really happening.

## cmsc351: may14, 4:00pm @ irb0324.

**Minimum Score (to keep an A):** $92\%$, but I would like at least a $93\%$ in case I sell the last few homeworks.
