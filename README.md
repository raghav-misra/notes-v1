# words.

## hello.

This is where I put down the things I learn!

## topics.

- **[incomplete]** [Discrete Math](topics/discrete_math.md) covers (will cover) the content of an intro set theory / discrete mathematics / proofs course, namely **CMSC250** (Discrete Structures) at UMD.
- **[incomplete]** [Probability Theory](topics/probability_theory.md) covers (will cover) the content of an intro probability theory course, at the very least **STAT400** (Applied Probability and Statistics I) at UMD.
- **[incomplete]** [Linear Algebra](topics/linear_algebra.md) covers (will cover) the content of mostly any introductory linear algebra course. I took **MATH2B** (Linear Algebra) at De Anza College. 

## misc.

Just go to [/misc](/misc) and see what there is for yourself.

## todo.

*:sparkles: In order of importance! :sparkles:*
