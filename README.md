## hello.

a collection of random ideas and notes.

## notes.

- **[incomplete]** [discrete math](discrete_math.md) covers the content of an intro set theory / discrete math / proofs course, namely **CMSC250** (Discrete Structures) at UMD.
- **[incomplete]** [probability theory](probability_theory.md) covers the content of an intro probability theory course, at the very least **STAT400** (Applied Probability and Statistics I) at UMD. I am not sure I'll find study materials detailed enough to cover the more in-depth content of **STAT410 **(Introduction to Probability Theory).

## misc.
