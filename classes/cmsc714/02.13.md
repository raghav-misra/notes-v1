## Reminder for Zaratan

Do NOT run OpenMP or anything multithreaded on the login node!

## Message passing with MPI

**MPI** stands for message passing interface.

### Distributed memory model

Each process only has access to local memory/address space.

When processes need data from remote processes, they send/receive messages.

### Message passing

**Parallel programming model:** achieved by making calls to a library and the execution model depends on the library used.

**Parallel runtime systems** implement the parallel execution model.

### MPI

Goals:

- Standardize prev. message passing designs and implementations.
- Copy-free message passing.
- Portable to many platforms; defines a *standard*, not an *implementation*.
