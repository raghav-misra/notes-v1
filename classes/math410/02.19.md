## Sequential Compactness Theorem

**Sequential Compactness Theorem:** Every interval $[a,b]$ where $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ is *sequentially compact*.

- **Proof:** Let $\{a_n\}$ be in $[a, b]$.
  
  So, $a \leq a_n \leq b$ for all $n$. That is, $a_n$ is bounded.
  
  By last class theorem, $a_n$ then has a convergent subsequence $\{a_{n_k}\}$
  
  Assume $\{a_{n_k}\} \rightarrow l$. Since $a \leq a_n \leq b$, then $a \leq a_{n_k} \leq b$.
  
  So, $l \in [a, b]$.
  
  Thus, there exists a convergent 

**Main result of 2.5:** $S$ is closed and bounded *if and only if* $S$ is compact.

## Functions and Continuity

### Functions

For a set of real numbers $D$, $f: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ denotes a function whose domain is in $D$.  We denote the value that $f$ assigns to some $x$ as $f(x)$. 

Most of this chapter discusses continuity, and then it will introduce limits and next chapter will discuss differentiability.

### Continuity

A function $f: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is said to be **continuous** *at the point* $x_0 \in D$ when for any sequence $\{x_n\} \rightarrow x_0$ is in $D$, $\{f(x_n)\} \rightarrow f(x_0)$.

- $f$ is **continuous**, generally, if it is continuous at every point in $D$.
