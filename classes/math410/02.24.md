## Applications of IVT

### Intermediate value theorem

Suppose $f: [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous. Let $c \in \mathbb{R}$ strictly between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. Then, $\exists x_0 \in (a, b)$ such that $f(x_0) = c$.

### Verify a solution exists

Example. Find that $x^5 + x + 1 = 0$ at a point.

- Test point. $x = 0$. Then $0^5 + 0 + 1 = 1 < 0$.
- $x = 1$. Then $1^5 + 1 + 1 = 3 > 0$.
- $x = -1$. Then $(-1)^5 + (-1) + 1 = -1 < 0$.
- Then, by IVT, where exists $x_0 \in (-1, 0)$ such that $x^5 + x + 1 = 0$.
- Yippee!

Example. For $x^2 = c$ where $c > 0$. Verify a solution exists.

- Rewrite: $x^2 - c = 0$. Let $f(x) = x^2 - c$ which is a continuous polynomial function.
- At $x = 0$, $f(0) = -c < 0$.
- At $x = c$, $f(c) = c^2 - c$, not guaranteed to be $+$ or $-$.
- At $x = c + 1$, $f(c + 1) = (c + 1)^2 - c = c^2 + 2c + 1 - c = c^2 + c + 1$.
  - $c$ is strictly positive, so $c^2 + c + 1 > 0$.
- By IVT, there exists $x_0 \in (0, c + t)$ such that $f(x_0) = c$.
- Then, $x^2 = c$ has a solution.

### Image is continuous interval

Let $I$ be an interval and $f: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous. Then, its image $f(I)$ is also an interval.

- Proof is done by IVT.

## Uniform continuity

### What is it 

All uniformly continuous functions are continuous; not necessarily vice versa.

A function $f: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is **uniformly continuous** if for all $\{u_n\}$ and $\{v_n\}$ with
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (u_n - v_n) = 0
$$
then we have 
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} [f(u_n) - f(v_n)] = 0.
$$
Notes:

- Does not make sense to say uniformly continuous at a point.
- Neither $u_n$ or $v_n$ need to converge.

### Examples

Let $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $f(x) = 3x$, show it is *uniformly continuous*.

- **Proof.** Let $\{u_n\}$ and $\{v_n\}$ be sequences in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $\{u_n - v_n\} \rightarrow 0$.

  (We want to show $\{f(u_n) - f(v_n)\} \rightarrow 0$.)
  $$
  \begin{align*}
  	\{f(u_n) - f(v_n)\} 
  		&= \{3u_n - 3v_n\} \\
  		&= 3 \cdot \{u_n - v_n\} \\
  		&\rightarrow 3 \cdot 0 = 0,
  \end{align*}
  $$
  as needed. $\square$

*More general result:* all linear functions are uniformly continuous.

Consider: $f(x) = x^2$ is NOT uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$.

- **Proof.** By counterexample.

  Let $u_n = \{n + \frac{1}{n}\}$ and $v_n = \{n\}$. Then,
  $$
  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \{u_n - v_n\}
  	= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \{n + \frac{1}{n} - n\}
  	= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0.
  $$
  Now consider the sequence $\{f(u_n) - f(v_n)\}$. Then,
  $$
  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \{f(u_n) - f(v_n)\}
  	= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left[ \left(n + \frac{1}{n}\right)^2 - n^2 \right] \\
  	= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left[n^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{n^2} - n^2 \right] \\
  	\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left[2 + \frac{1}{n^2} \right] \\
  	= 2 + 0 = 2.
  $$
  $2 \neq 0$ so $f$ cannot be uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$.

Uniformly continuous functions will *NOT* have unbounded derivatives.

Consider: $f: (0, 2) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ is *NOT* uniformly continuous.

- **Proof.** By counterexample.

  Let $u_n = \{\frac{1}{n}\}$ and $v_n = \frac{2}{n}$. Then,
  $$
  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} [u_n - v_n]
  = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left[\frac{1}{n} - \frac{2}{n} \right] = 0.
  $$
  Now consider $\{f(u_n) - f(v_n)\}$. Then,
  $$
  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} [f(u_n) - f(v_n)]
  = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left[n - \frac{n}{2} \right] = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n}{2} = \infty.
  $$
  So this difference of images diverges, definitely not converging to $0$, so $f$ must *NOT* be uniformly continuous. $\square$

Instead consider $f: (2, 3)$ where $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ is uniformly continuous.

- **Proof.**

  Suppose $\{u_n - v_n\} \rightarrow 0$ for $\{u_n\}$ and $\{v_n\}$ in $(2, 3)$. Then,
  $$
  \begin{align*}
  	|f(u_n) - f(v_n)| 
  		&= |\frac{1}{u_n} - \frac{1}{v_n}| \\
  		&= |\frac{v_n - u_n}{u_n v_n}| \\
  		&= |\frac{u_n - v_n}{u_n v_n}|
  \end{align*}
  $$
  We have $u_n > 2$ and $v_n > 2$ since they are in $(2, 3)$. So $\frac{1}{u_n} < 2$ and $\frac{1}{v_n} < 2$. Then,
  $$
  \begin{align*}
  	|\frac{v_n - u_n}{u_n v_n}|
  		&= |\frac{v_n - u_n}{2 \cdot 2}| \\
  		&= \frac{1}{4} \cdot |u_n - v_n| \\
  		&\rightarrow 0 \text{ by comparison lemma!}
  \end{align*}
  $$
   So we have that $f$ is uniformly continuous over $(2, 3)$ $\square$.
