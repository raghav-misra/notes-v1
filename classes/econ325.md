## long run growth of us economy.

Why has the US seen steady long-run growth (GDP per capita) over the past 100 years? **Technology.**

USA **real** (inflation-adjusted) income per capita has growth at around $2\%$ per year. Since the industrial revolution, **exponential growth**. Since the end of WWII, output has closely tracked **labor productivity**, once again because of technological improvement.

USA is a **consumer economy**, $C$ is main driver of the GDP. In addition, investment $I$ is very volatile, plays a significant role. Government spending $G$ has not growth very much, interestingly. Net exports $X$ is negative, as we import more than we export. (This class will not discuss $X$​, it considers closed economies.)

## business cycles + recessions in the us.

Annual change in RGDP per capita is very volatile. (Not cyclical or consistent.) In the long run, RGDP per capita grows, but short run has many booms and busts. Consumption $C$ is much less volatile than $I$​.

Since 1900, the US has seen $23$​ recessions. Who declares recessions? **Economists.** More specifically, the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee. Academics are in charge of this to eliminate political influence, as well as so that people who are *knowledgeable* are in control.

## microeconomics $\rightarrow$ macroeconomics.

We will start from **microeconomics**: decisions of consumers and firms, to end up with **macroeconomics**: **aggregate** and national outcomes.

- Measuring prices: $P$ is price, $W$ is wages.
- Measuring quantity: 
  - $C$ is consumer spending.
  - $I$ is investment / capital formation.
  - $G$ is government spending.
  - $X$ is exports.

We want to understand long-run growth and short-run business cycles.

**Macroeconomics** is **individual optimization** $+$ **market clearing**.

## building blocks of macroeconomy.

**Private** sector: **consumers** and **firms**.

- Consumers and firms meet in the **labor**, **goods**, and **credit** markets. 
- Consumers balance how much they work and consume. 
  - They maximize their utility function $U$.
- Firms decide how many workers to hire. 
  - Firms want to maximize profit function $\pi$.

**Public** sector: **fiscal** and **monetary** authority.

- Fiscal authority needs to fund its spending by balancing its budget with taxes.
- Monetary authority wants to maximize utility $U$ of consumers.

How do these sectors interact?

- Regulations (protecting firms and consumers).
- Taxes & government spending.
- Lender of last resort.
- Monetary policy.

## modeling an economy.

We will make simplifying assumptions:

- Optimizing representative agents (firms + consumers).
  - Assume consumer happiness is defined by maximizing $U$.
  - Modeling the behavior of "average" agent, whether that is desires, income level, etc.
  - Ignoring inequality.
- All agents have perfect information.
  - Consumers already know what they need to make consumption-leisure decisions.
  - Forms know how much capital to invest in already.
- Perfect competition (no agents have market power).
  - No entry/exit costs for firms.
  - No profit in the long run.
  - Firms are price takers, not setters.
  - All goods are the same.
- Flexible prices adjust to balance supply and demand.

**Our goal** is that to create our own model of the economy, in which we can theorize events and predict outcomes.

A **model** itself is a set of linked equations that work together to demonstrate the workings of the economy.

## consumer choices.

To demonstrate aggregate consumers, we take the representative and scale it by the total number of consumers. The **representative consumer**:

- Likes consumption and leisure. 
  - Preferences represented by utility function **$U(c, l)$​.
- Buys goods in a competitive **goods market**.
- Supplies labor in a competitive **labor market**.
- Owns the **representative firms** and gets any profits.
  - Firm want to maximize profit *because* owners (consumers) want to maximize utility.
- Makes choices independently in each period (A **static world** where consumers don't think about the future.)
- **Goal:** choose $(c, l)$​​ to maximize utility subject to budget constraints.

## utility function.

We want to model utility with math; develop a function $U(c, l)$ with properties:

- Utility increases with both consumption and leisure.
  - $U_c(c, l) = \frac{\partial U(c, l)}{\partial c} > 0$​, utility increases with consumption.
  - $U_l(c, l) = \frac{\partial U(c, l)}{\partial l} > 0$, utility increases with leisure.
- Diminishing marginal utility.
  - $U_{cc}(c, l) = \frac{\partial U_c(c, l)}{\partial c} < 0$​.
  - $U_{ll}(c, l) = \frac{\partial U_l(c, l)}{\partial l} < 0$.
