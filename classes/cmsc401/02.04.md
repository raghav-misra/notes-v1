## Point-in-polygon, cont'd.

### Algorithm input and output:

**Input:**

- A polygon $PL$, encoded as a list of its vertices (points).
  - Each pair of consecutive vertices is an edge.
  - $p_1$ and $p_n$ also make an edge in the $n$-vertex polygon.
- A point $P$.

**Output:** One of the following:

- $P$ is in the exterior of $PL$.
- $P$ is in the interior of $PL$.
- $P$ is on $PL$.

### Main algorithm

**Steps:**

1. Loop over all the edges of $PL$ and intersect each edge with the horizonal half-line $L$ with origin in $P$.
   1. `Intersect_Edge` algorithm.
2. If the number $k$ of intersections between $L$ and $PL$ is even:
   1. $P$ is **outside** (on the exterior of) $PL$.
3. Else ($k$ is odd):
   1. $P$ is either **inside** (on the interior) or **on** $PL$.
   2. If $P$ is the intersection between an edge of $PL$ and $L$, then $p$ is **on** $PL$. 

### `Intersect_Edge` algorithm

**Input:**

1. An edge $e$ of $PL$.
2. Query point $P$.

**Output:** The algorithm computes the intersection between edge $e$ and the horizontal half-line $L$ originating at $P$. Returns one of:

- $0$: no intersection.
- $1$: intersection.
- $2$: $p$ is on edge $e$.
