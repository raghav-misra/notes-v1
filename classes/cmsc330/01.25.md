## course overview.

This class focuses on the theory of programming languages, rather than just learning to code in them. Programming languages are like spoken languages: a form of communication that conveys information. (In this case, instructions for a computer.) 

**Why do so many languages exist?** Languages have different strengths and weaknesses. Part of this course discusses the pros and cons of various languages and programming styles.

- Language features help us express ourselves.
- **Semantics** (what does it mean) and **syntax** (how to write it).

**The goal** of this course is for us to make our own programming language. 

- We will write an interpreter.
- Combine elements of programming languages.
