### Diffusion on the half-line

We will consider heat equation for $0 < x < \infty$. We will have a boundary point at $x = 0$. So we'll need a BC at $x = 0$;

*Our problem:* Start with $v_t = k v_{xx}$ for $0 < x < \infty$ and $t > 0$.

- **Initial condition:** $\lim_{t \rightarrow 0^{+}} [v(x, t)] = \phi(x)$.
  - Sometimes people get lazy and just say $v(x, 0) = \phi(x)$.
- **Boundary condition:** $v(0, t) = 0$ for all $t \geq 0$.
- *Note:* $phi(x)$ is only defined for $x > 0$, the half-line.
