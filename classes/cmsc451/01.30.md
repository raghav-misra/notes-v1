## Graph Basics

### Definitions

A **graph** $G = (V, E)$ is a bunch of vertices/nodes in set $V$ that are connected as defined by the edges in the set $E$. Key things:

- Edges can be *directed*, think arrows instead of lines. A graph that has directed edges is called a **digraph** (directed graph).

- We assume that undirected graphs do not have self-loops, and that edges are *unique*, here meaning:

  - Nodes in an undirected graph are not doubly connected. 

    **Bad:**

    ```

  - A given node in a digraph does not point to another node multiple times.

    **Bad:**

    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
    
    A --> B
    A --> B
    ```

    **Acceptable:**

    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
    
    A-->B
    B-->A
    ```

Given an edge $e = (u, v)$ in a digraph, we say $u$ is the origin of $e$ and $v$ is the destination of $e$.
